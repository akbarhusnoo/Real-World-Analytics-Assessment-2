# Real-World-Analytics-Assessment-2

As part of my master's degree, I had to complete this assessment in R Programming Language which focusses on analysing the behaviour and pattern of weather time series. 

The average monthly temperature dataset utilised for this assessment was obtained from the National Climatic Data Centre. The weather dataset period downloaded ranges from January 1959 to January 1979. 

This assessment includes:
1. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing;
2. Summary measures and Data Visualisation;
3. Log Transformation of Average Temperature Values;
4. Calculation of Drift Rate and Volatility Rate for Geometric Brownian Motion
5. Using Geometric Brownian Motion for Prediction.
